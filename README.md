1. First clone the repository.

2. Open the solution and select Set as Startup Project "SalesManagement.Infrastructure". 

3. Run the update-database command in the package manager console.

Special Note: If your database already has a database named "SalesManagmentFinalDB", it must first be deleted, then the update database command must be run.

4. In the cloned repository you will see a .sql file named "Dummy Data for SalesManagementDB.sql", this query needs to be executed. In this you will get the necessary dummy data for all the tables to test the application.


5. Then "https://github.com/mehedimd/SalesManagementAngular" can clone this Angular repository for the front end and run it to test the application.
